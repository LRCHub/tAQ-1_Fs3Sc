We don't care if you only love "we"
We don't care if you only love "we"
We love you
We love you and we hope that you will love "we" too
We love "they"
We love "they" and we want you to love "they" too
Aah

We don't care if you hound "we" and
Love is all around "we"
Love can't get our minds off
We love you, we love you

You will never win "we"
Your uniforms don't fit "we"
We forget the place we're in
We love you
We love you. Of course, we do

I,I,I,I love you
I,I,I,I love you
And I hope that you won't prove wrong too
We love you. We do
We love you. We do
Ah...
We love you,we love you
